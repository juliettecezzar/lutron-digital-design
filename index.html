    <h1>Digital Design: Principles and Practice</h1>
  
  <p>Welcome!</p>

<p>One of the hallmarks of visual design is that its conditions, audiences, tools, media, and processes are continuously changing. This also makes design a great place to be: because we are always learning, the work is always interesting.
</p>
<p>We will have some sessions together in the next few months where we will explore together some of the shifts in thinking and practice in design that spans real and virtual worlds. For the first three sessions, we will begin with how some of the fundamentals have changed (and not changed), move on the UX and accessibility, and then talk about creating and maintaining brand systems and work processes that support iterative digital design. The goal is to have a shared language and understanding of how design has changed and where it is going.
</p>
<p>We will be focused on design rather than marketing or strategy, not because those topics are not important, but because they have already been covered in a separate training. We will talk, however, about how design increasingly works _with_ marketing, copywriting, and engineering to create a welcoming and informative world for the wide variety of people who interact with the company and its products.
